# battleships

Play battleships on a microcontroller using micro or Circuit Python and a serial terminal. 

Files:
* code.py - battleships game
instructions.txt - installation and game play
* license - MIT license
* README.md - this file

The code runs  on an Adafruit Circuit Playground Express, an ESP32 M5 Stick, a Raspberry Pi Zero and on my Windows machine with Python 3.

I couldn't get it to run on an ESP8266 Feather board since its  version of micro Python didn't support the random library.

It also failed on a BBC Micro Bit with an out of memory error.
